# Section 3
This repository contains the course materials and the class assignment for Section 3 of AST 5031 and AST 4031.

## Course materials
To complete this section you will need to use the material presented during the first two lectures of the course

## Assignment
After that you will have to complete the Jupyter Notebook named `Section-3.ipynb` that this repository contains. You should write code to solve the problems it contains, committing your solutions as you go, and pushing the final result back to GitHub.

The notebook itself contains detailed instructions and explains the problems you need to solve.

## Resources
You may need to refer to the online documentation for `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Note that some of the words rendered in `monospaced` font in the `Section-3.ipynb` notebook are links to relevant documentation.
